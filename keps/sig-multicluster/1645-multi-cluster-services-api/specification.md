## 0 - About This Document

This document is a specification for DNS-based Kubernetes service discovery for
clusters implementing the [Multicluster Service API](README.md).

## 1 - Schema Version

This document describes version 1.0.0 of the schema.

## 2 - Resource Records

Any DNS-based service discovery solution for Kubernetes clusters implementing
the Multicluster Services API must provide the resource records (RR) described
below to be considered compliant with this specification.

### 2.1 - Definitions

This proposal is intended as an extension of the [cluster-local Kubernetes DNS
specification](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md),
and inherits its definitions from section 2.1 with the addition of the
following:

hostname = as already defined in the [cluster-local Kubernetes DNS
specification](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md),
this refers (in brief): in order of precedence, to a) the value of the
endpoint's `hostname` field, or b) a unique, system-assigned identifier for the
endpoint. Of importance to highlight is that since the [default hostname of an
endpoint is the Pod's `metadata.name`
field](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-hostname-and-subdomain-fields),
this will likely often be the podname, but not always, and implementations must
prefer a directly specified `hostname` value.

clusterset = as defined in [KEP-1645: Multi-Cluster Services API](README.md): “A
placeholder name for a group of clusters with a high degree of mutual trust and
shared ownership that share services amongst themselves. Membership in a
clusterset is symmetric and transitive. The set of member clusters are mutually
aware, and agree about their collective association. Within a clusterset,
[namespace
sameness](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-multicluster/namespace-sameness-position-statement.md)
applies and all namespaces with a given name are considered to be the same
namespace.”

`<clusterset-zone>` = domain for multi-cluster services in the clusterset, which
must be `clusterset.local`; as this may become configurable in the future, this
specification refers to it by the placeholder `<clusterset-zone>`, but per the
MCS API it currently must be defined to be `clusterset.local`. 

ClusterSetIP / `<clusterset-ip>` / clusterset IP = as defined in [KEP-1645:
Multi-Cluster Services API](README.md): “A non-headless ServiceImport is
expected to have an associated IP address, the clusterset IP, which may be
accessed from within an importing cluster. This IP may be a single IP used
clusterset-wide or assigned on a per-cluster basis, but is expected to be
consistent for the life of a ServiceImport from the perspective of the importing
cluster. Requests to this IP from within a cluster will route to backends for
the aggregated Service.”

Cluster ID / `<clusterid>` = TODO the cluster id stored in the `id.k8s.io
ClusterProperty` as described in [KEP-2149: ClusterId for ClusterSet
identification](../2149-clusterid/README.md). Though this can be any valid DNS
label, the recommended value is  a kube-system namespace uid ( such as
`721ab723-13bc-11e5-aec2-42010af0021e`). For ease of KEP readability, this
document uses human readable names `cluster-a` and `cluster-b` to represent the
cluster IDs of two clusters in a ClusterSet.


### 2.2 - Record for Schema Version

Following the existing specification, clusters implementing multicluster DNS
will contain an additional `TXT` record responding with the semantic version of
the DNS schema used for the multi cluster DNS `<zone>`, also known in this
specification as `<clusterset-zone>`.

- Question Example:
  - `dns-version.clusterset.local. IN TXT`
- Answer Example:
  - `dns-version.clusterset.local. 28800 IN TXT “1.0.0”`

### 2.3 - Records for a Service with ClusterSetIP

#### 2.3.1 - `A`/`AAAA` Record

_Note: This section refers to `A` and `AAAA` record requirements. For Service
objects that have dual-stack networking enabled, both `A` and `AAAA` records
must be created to cover both IPv4 and IPv6 assigned ClusterSetIPs._

Given a ClusterIP type Service named `<service>` in Namespace `<ns>` that has
been exported via a name-mapped ServiceExport with name `<service>`, and given
its endpoints are accessible from a given cluster by the IP address
`<clusterset-ip>`, the following records must exist.

If the `<clusterset-ip>` is an IPv4 address, an `A` record of the following form
must exist.



*   Record Format:
    *   `<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. <ttl> IN A <clusterset-ip>`
*   Question Example
    *   `myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. IN A`
*   Answer Example:
    *   `myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN A 10.42.42.42`

If the `<clusterset-ip>` is an IPv6 address, an `AAAA` record of the following
form must exist.



*   Record Format:
    *   `<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. <ttl> IN AAAA <clusterset-ip>`
*   Question Example:
    *   `myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. IN AAAA`
*   Answer Example:
    *   `myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN AAAA 2001:db8::1`


#### 2.3.2 - `SRV` Records

For each port in an exported Service with name `<port>` and number
`<port-number>` using protocol `<proto>`, an `SRV` record of the following form
must exist.



*   Record Format:
    *   `_<port>._<proto>.<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. <ttl> IN SRV
        <weight> <priority> <port-number> <service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>.`

The priority `<priority>` and weight `<weight>` are numbers as described in
[RFC2782](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782) and whose values are not
prescribed by this specification.

Unnamed ports do not have an `SRV` record.



*   Question Example:
    *   `_https._tcp.myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. IN SRV`
*   Answer Example:
    *   `_https._tcp.myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. 30 IN SRV 10 100 443
        myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local.`

The Additional section of the response may include the Service `A`/`AAAA` record
referred to in the `SRV` record.

#### 2.3.3 - `PTR` Record

`PTR` records are not specified in any way for multicluster DNS and `PTR`
records ending with the `<clusterset-zone>` are **NOT** required. (See the DNS
section of the [KEP-1645: Multi-Cluster Services
API](README.md#no-ptr-records-necessary-for-multicluster-DNS) for more context.)

#### 2.3.4 - Records that MUST NOT exist for a Service with ClusterSetIP

ClusterSetIP Services **MUST NOT** have a record disambiguating to a single
cluster's backends, ex. `<clusterid>.<svc>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>`. This
form is reserved for possible future use and as updates to the MCS API standard
may define its use in a specific way, implementations must not use or depend on
DNS records of this form.

(See the DNS section of the [KEP-1645: Multi-Cluster Services
API](README.md#not-allowing-cluster-specific-targeting-via-dns) for more
context.)

### 2.4 - Records for a Multicluster Headless Service

#### 2.4.1 - `A`/`AAAA` Records

_Note: This section refers to `A` and `AAAA` record requirements. For Service
objects that have dual-stack networking enabled, both `A` and `AAAA` records
must be created to cover both IPv4 and IPv6 assigned pod IPs._

Given a headless Service named `<service>` in Namespace `<ns>` that has been
exported via a name-mapped ServiceExport with name `<service>`, for a subset of
_ready_ endpoints accessible across the cluster set with the IPv4 address
`<endpoint-ip>`, the following records must exist.

The subset of _ready_ endpoints _may_ be all _ready_ endpoints, but the exact
subset is implementation dependent due to performance restrictions and response
size limit of the DNS server used, as the number of potential endpoints could be
quite high depending on the number of backends exported across the ClusterSet.



*   Record Format:
    *   `<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. IN A <endpoint-ip>`
*   Question Example
    *   `myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local IN A`
*   Answer Example:
    *   `myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local 4 IN A 10.42.42.42`
    *   `myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local 4 IN A 10.10.10.10`

There must also be an `A` record of the following form for each _ready_ endpoint
in the same subset with hostname of `<hostname>`, member cluster ID of
`<clusterid>`, and IPv4 address `<endpoint-ip>`. If there are multiple IPv4
addresses for a given hostname, then there must be one such `A` record returned
for each IP.



*   Record Format:
    *   `<hostname>.<clusterid>.<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. <ttl> IN A
        <endpoint-ip>`
*   Question Example:
    *   `my-hostname.cluster-a.myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. IN A`
*   Answer Example:
    *   `my-hostname.cluster-a.myservice.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN A
        10.3.0.100`

There must be an `AAAA` record each for a subset of _ready_ endpoints of the
headless Service with IPv6 address `<endpoint-ip>` as shown below. If there are
no _ready_ endpoints for the headless Service, the answer should be `NXDOMAIN`.

The subset of _ready_ endpoints _may_ be all _ready_ endpoints, but the exact
subset is implementation dependent (as mentioned above). If both `A` and `AAAA`
records exist, they must program the same subset of IPs.



*   Record Format:
    *    `<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. <ttl> IN AAAA <endpoint-ip>`
*   Question Example:
    *    `headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. IN AAAA`
*   Answer Example:
    *    `headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN AAAA 2001:db8::1`
    *    `headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN AAAA 2001:db8::2`
    *    `headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN AAAA 2001:db8::3`

There must also be an `AAAA` record of the following form for each ready
endpoint in the same subset with hostname of `<hostname>`, member cluster ID of
`<clusterid>`, and IPv6 address `<endpoint-ip>`. If there are multiple IPv6
addresses for a given hostname, then there must be one such `A` record returned
for each IP.



*   Record Format:
    *   `<hostname>.<clusterid>.<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. <ttl> IN
        AAAA <endpoint-ip>`
*   Question Example:
    *   `my-hostname.cluster-a.test.svc.clusterset.local. IN AAAA`
*   Answer Example:
    *   `my-hostname.cluster-a.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN AAAA 2001:db8::1`

#### 2.4.2 - `SRV` Records

For each combination of _ready_ endpoint with _hostname_ of `<hostname>`, member
cluster ID of `<clusterid>`, and port in the Service with name `<port>` and
number `<port-number>` using protocol `<proto>`, an `SRV` record of the
following form must exist.



*   Record Format:
    *    `_<port>._<proto>.<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>. <ttl> IN SRV
         <weight> <priority> <port-number>
         <hostname>.<clusterid>.<service>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>.`

This implies that if there are **N** _ready_ endpoints and the Service defines
**M** named ports, there will be **N** X **M**  **`SRV`** RRs for the Service.

The priority `<priority>` and weight `<weight>` are numbers as described in
[RFC2782](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782) and whose values are not
prescribed by this specification.

Unnamed ports do not have an `SRV` record.

In the following example, the cluster ID for each answer example is in bold to
emphasize that the union of records from all clusters are returned by a SRV
record request.

*   Question Example:
    *    `_https._tcp.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. IN SRV`
*   Answer Example:
    *   `_https._tcp.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN SRV 10 100 443
        my-pet-1.`**`cluster-a`**`.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local.`
    *   `_https._tcp.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN SRV 10 100 443
        my-pet-2.`**`cluster-a`**`.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local.`
    *   `_https._tcp.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN SRV 10 100 443
        my-pet-3.`**`cluster-a`**`.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local.`
    *   `_https._tcp.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN SRV 10 100 443
        my-pet-1.`**`cluster-b`**`.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local.`
    *   `_https._tcp.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN SRV 10 100 443
        my-pet-2.`**`cluster-b`**`.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local.`
    *   `_https._tcp.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local. 4 IN SRV 10 100 443
        my-pet-3.`**`cluster-b`**`.headless.test.svc.clusterset.local.`

The Additional section of the response may include the `A`/`AAAA` records
referred to in the `SRV` records.

#### 2.4.3 - `PTR` Records

`PTR` records are not specified in any way for multicluster DNS and `PTR`
records ending with the `<clusterset-zone>` are **NOT** required. (See the DNS
section of the [KEP-1645: Multi-Cluster Services
API](README.md#no-ptr-records-necessary-for-multicluster-DNS) for more context.)

#### 2.4.4 - Records that MUST NOT exist for a Multicluster Headless Service

Multicluster Headless Services **MUST NOT** have a record disambiguating to a
single cluster's backends, ex. `<clusterid>.<svc>.<ns>.svc.<clusterset-zone>`.
This form is reserved for possible future use and as updates to the MCS API
standard may define its use in a specific way, implementations must not use or
depend on DNS records of this form.
